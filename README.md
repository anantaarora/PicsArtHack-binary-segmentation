# PicsArt-Hack-binary_segmentation

The goal of the hackathon was to build a solution for image processing which can be helpful for [PicsArt](https://picsart.com/?hl=en) applications.  
Here I publish results for the first stage: segmenting people on photos.
PicsArt gives us labeled [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_e2DcZnjufx35uSmQElN5mpdo-Rlv7ZI/view?usp=sharing).  
[Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) coef. was used as evaluation metric.
